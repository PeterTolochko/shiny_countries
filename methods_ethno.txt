The used data was obtained through participant and ethnographic observation during the ongoing BBNJ negotiations. 
During the second and third two-week IGC sessions at the United Nations' New York Headquarters, we conducted CEE at the site where governments negotiate the BBNJ Treaty. 
CEE has become a widely accepted research method in international environmental politics which uses intergovernmental negotiations as field sites for data collection (<a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/GLEP_e_00236?mobileUi=0">Campbell et al., 2014</a>;

Further, CEE enables the researcher to collect different data types, such as interview material, field notes, and visual and audio material, and to connect various data sources (Gray et al., 2020).
During plenaries, working group sessions, and side events, we took systematic field notes based on a matrix, in which we entered observations on contextual factors, 
such as the delegation of the speaker, the section of the draft being addressed, whether the statement made reference to scientific knowledge and a full description of the statement's content. 
Notes on statements content are close to transcripts of a stateâ€™s expression of views. 
Regarding the first IGC, which the research team did not attend, we watched the proceedings via the UN webcast and made transcripts. 
Detailed information on organizing institutions, speakers, and content was also gathered at side events. Furthermore, participant lists served as an additional source of information. <br>

The obtained ethnographic data was then analyzed using the R programming language. In R, we aggregated all individual observations and analyzed the whole dataset quantitatively according to our variables of interest. 
In the following we give an overview about the variables and how they were derived from the data. <br> 
<br>
The variable 	<em> Concepts used in Statements </em> scans the bulk of statements for key scientific concepts identified in the bibliometric analysis. <br>
<em>Participants </em> gives an overview about the delegation size of each state, adding the delegation sizes of the CBD COP 2018.<br>
The variable <em> References to Science </em> counts the amount of times the researcher indicated that the statement at hand made reference to scientific knowledge or used scientific reasoning to support the states' position.<br>
The variable <em> Talk Time </em> aggregates the time that each actor in the negotiations spoke - and if available the aggregated time of its alliance. Each observation in the matrix received a time stamp and with this the difference between points of observations could be calculated as the time that each participant spoke.
