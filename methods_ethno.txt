The used data was obtained through participant and ethnographic observation during the ongoing BBNJ negotiations. During the second and third two-week IGC sessions at the United Nations' New York Headquarters, we conducted CEE at the site where governments negotiate the BBNJ Treaty. During plenaries, working group sessions, and side events, we took systematic field notes based on a matrix, in which we entered observations on contextual factors, such as the delegation of the speaker, the section of the draft being addressed, and a description of the statement's content. Notes on statements content are close to transcripts of a stateâ€™s expression of views. Regarding the first IGC, which the research team did not attend, we watched the proceedings via the UN webcast and made transcripts.  Detailed information on organizing institutions, speakers, and content was also gathered at side events. Furthermore, participant lists served as an additional source of information. <br>

The obtained ethnographic data was then analyzed quantitatively using the R programming language. In the following we give an overview about the variables and how they were derived from the data.
